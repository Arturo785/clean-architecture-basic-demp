The center circle is the most abstract, and the outer circle is the most concrete.
 This is called the Abstraction Principle.
  The Abstraction Principle specifies that inner circles should contain business logic,

This rule specifies that each circle can depend only on the nearest inward circle
 â€” this is what makes the architecture work.
